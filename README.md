# KeriumUniverse

Kerium is a true highly deflationary, gamble, and community coin which is 
currently running on the Binance Smart Chain

There will be a total amount of 6 Billion coins from which a total of 35 % will be 
burned after reaching 1, 5, 10 and 20 million Marketcap. This burn will reward all 
early Investors because There is an 18% fee for each Transaction from which 5% 
will be reflected in bnb to all holders. The other 13 % fee is divided into 5% 
Burns, 4% LPs, and 4% Joker function. At the end of each Month the Community 
can decide if the Coins in the Joker Wallet should be used for Buy Backs, Burns, 
Marketing, Lottery, Charity, or as Reflections for all holders. Early Investors will 
profit from the burns that will happen when we hit 1, 5, 10 and 20 million 
Marketcap. During these 4 events, 35% of the total token supply will be burned, 
from which 5% will go back in bnb reflections to all holders.  
Wallets that are holding more than 30 % of the total supply won ́t receive 
reflections. That way holders will receive more reflections when the Burn Wallet 
and Joker Wallet reach this limit. Only Kerium Holders that won’t sell for a 
minimum of 28 Days will receive the Tax from the Joker Wallet. There will be a 
Tax-free day every month where Investors don't have to pay the 18% buy tax.
